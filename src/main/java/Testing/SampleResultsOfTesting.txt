1,I have read all 3 of this books. Princess Diaries 1 was the best one until this one. All i can say is pure perfection. The ending was truthfully perfect. I cried for 10 mins bc i couldn't get over the fact on how great it was... yeah it sounds nerdy
1,This book is as much fun as the two before it. In the manner that only teen novels have  it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the last page. Mia is her loveable vaguely neurotic self  Lilly is as irritating as ever  and Grandmere displays a ra
1,The last of the Princess Diaries (or so I assume  because the ending sentence is so final-sounding)  Princess in Love is by far my favorite.  Mia  a freshman at Albert Einstein High School  is now approaching her final exams.  To add to that stress
3,Keeping up with granddaughters - finding books that they can read and we can discuss and we can both enjoy
1,This was an awesome book. Had lots of good Romance and surprises. Probably suits teens more than children though. :)
3,This book was so awesome!!!! I finished it in 35 minutes!!!! Seriously. The ending just makes you feel so good anout everything. Everybody's reviews of it were good too. But  that one girl Ashley  obviously wasn't thinking. You're gonna ruin the endi
3,Perfect mix of comedy  romance  and sensibility. I have read it 7366483 times  maybe more! I highly recommend you read this book.
1,This is a way awesome book! It is  so far  my favorite in the Princess Diaries Series. This book deals more with Mia and love. Mia is in love with Michael  but her boyfriend is Kenny. Also  Mia is preparing for her trip to Genovia  the country she is
3,This very charming third book in the Princess Diaries Series was not at all disapointing. In fact  it was WONDERFUL! Ms. Cabot has done it again--her books in this series are always so realistically written.Mia  Princess Mia that is  finally has a bo
2,This was a specific request from my daughter...... it's exactly what she wanted.  It arrived later than I had hoped but I ordered late.
1,In this third Princess Diaries installment  Mia finally has a boyfriend...but she doesn't love him. Instead  she's still suffering from a crush on her best friend's brother. As usual  Mia records her love troubles  along with her struggles to find ti
3,Princess in Love is definately the best book yet!  Now that Mia has a boyfriend  her love letter writer Kenny  you'd think she'd be happy. Wrong!  She is still deep in the throes of her crush on Michael.  Not that he notices.  He's too busy with Judi
1,It's just a really cute story  & relatable. I'm glad I picked this up. I'm also sorry my review won't be as complete because I'm too anxious to get to the next book.
3,You expect it to be be not as good as the other ones but Meg cabot has kept up the remakable standed. I found the futher it got to the end the better it was so hold on if you find yourself thinking it is not as good as the other ones you should wait
3,This book was extremely good- I really enjoyed hearing the gospel of Mia again! Meg Cabot has created such a realistic and lovable character  that I can't help but sympathize with every ordeal our Royal hero endures...
1,I don't know whether Meg Cabot has exhausted every possible joke about 34A cup Mia Thermopolis or if I have just outgrown her humor  but I do know that I only laughed once the entire time I read this book.Let's backtrack for a sec..Mia is fourteen an

1,This book was very good ! Read it to fin out if Mia can figure out what to do with her love life ! I would reccomend this to any one who liked the other Princess diary books.
1,I loved this book! I've read  The Princess Diaries  and  Princess in the Spotlight  too but I have to say that  Princess in Love  was my favorite. If you want a book that you won't be able to put down until you finish it read this one! I couldn't sto
3,Yet again  Mia Thermopolis is met with matters of the heart. She talks about Kenny--her like for him that doesn't blossom into a love. She continues to obsess about Michael Moscovitz and tries to keep her feelings sheltered from her best friend Lilly
4,I thought that this was the best  Princess Diaries  book that I've read yet! I really thought that it was the best written and had a definite plot. I loved it - especially the happy ending.
1,I think Princess in Love was okay. It wasn't as good as the first two  because Mia is like the voice of reality sometimes. The going always gets tough. I think it would have been better if the ending was a surprise. Not one of those standard endings.
3,This book was good and light and I finished it with happy  warm  fuzzy feelings in my heart. As always  the diary style of the book is well-done and allows a better glimpse into the mind of Mia. With intelligent wit and and an interesting plot  you c

1,I was really looking forward to reading the last of this wonderful series. I couldn't wait to see how Mia dealt with her enormous crush on her best friend's brother Michael. What Meg Cabot delivered did not disappoint. I finished the book in two days

3,So far  book three is the best  in my opinion. I loved how everything ties up at the end. It's perfect. What happens when Mia is with the wrong guy? She doesn't want to hurt his feelings  b/c she's in love with Michael! This book is awesome. I am wai

1,I liked this book a lot. The only thing I disliked is the fact that Mia whines about everything  her love life  her grades  her grandmother  her princess duties. It's a little bit annoying  but it is a good book.
2,What a great series! Mia is a socially concious  vegetarian teen with all the trials of being a teenager. While she's not very popular and not very pretty  she has every girl's fantasy as her own reality: she's a princess. The best part of these book

1,I didn't quite like the ending and the story of the third volume. Tina turned out to be more of a bestfriend of Mia and Lilly turned out to be more freaky. The ending didn't end well because it just leaved you hanging on a cliff but I like the way ho
